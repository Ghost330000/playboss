The previous AI engineer meticulously followed a two-phase development trajectory to create the Zer0Play website, inspired by GGMAX. Initially, the project was named PlayBoss and focused on replicating the core visual and functional aspects: homepage, product pages, Pix payment simulation, order forms, and basic support. The engineer utilized ,  (though with some initial errors), and  for image acquisition, demonstrating tool proficiency.

The second phase involved a significant enhancement based on new user requirements. This included rebranding to Zer0Play, adopting GGMAX's specific color palette (dark base with red highlights), and implementing advanced features such as SEO optimization (meta tags, lazy loading), an auto-stock system, countdown timers, product recommendations, a review system, a newsletter popup, order tracking, and social proof. The development primarily revolved around  and  for a monolithic frontend approach, using React and Tailwind CSS. The process involved multiple file writes and a new  plugin installation, showcasing iterative development and a strong emphasis on detailed UI/UX for an AHA moment.
